# Bank-Churn-Data-Exploration-and-Churn-Prediction
The project focuses on predicting customer churn in banking using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree) and optimizing accuracy through resampling methods like random oversampling and K-Fold cross-validation.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ankush Solanke

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about leveraging machine learning to solve business problems, currently focusing on customer churn prediction in the banking sector.

ðŸ’¼ My project explores customer behavior patterns before they end their relationship with banks, utilizing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Trees.

ðŸ”¬ Key highlights:

Random Forest performed best with Random Oversampling and Bootstrapped samples.
Decision Tree showed optimal accuracy using K-Fold Cross Validation.

ðŸŽ¯ Specializing in:

Customer behavior analysis
Predictive modeling
Resampling techniques for machine learning
